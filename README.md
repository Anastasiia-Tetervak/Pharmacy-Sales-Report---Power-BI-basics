## Dataset
The dataset used in this tutorial is derived from an initial dataset consisting of 600,000 transactional records collected over a span of 6 years (2014-2019). These records include the date and time of sale, the brand name of the pharmaceutical drug, and the quantity sold. The data was exported from a Point-of-Sale system used in an individual pharmacy.

### Drug Categories
The selected group of drugs from the dataset consists of 57 drugs classified into the following Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System categories:

-  M01AB: Anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products, non-steroids, Acetic acid derivatives, and related substances
-  M01AE: Anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products, non-steroids, Propionic acid derivatives
-  N02BA: Other analgesics and antipyretics, Salicylic acid and derivatives
-  N02BE/B: Other analgesics and antipyretics, Pyrazolones and Anilides
-  N05B: Psycholeptics drugs, Anxiolytic drugs
-  N05C: Psycholeptics drugs, Hypnotics, and sedatives drugs
-  R03: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases
-  R06: Antihistamines for systemic use

### Resampling
The sales data has been resampled to daily, monthly, quarterly, and yearly periods for analysis. The data has already been pre-processed, which involved outlier detection and treatment, as well as missing data imputation.
